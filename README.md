Task 3: Multimodal ML – Housing Price Prediction Using Images + Tabular
Data
Objective:
Predict housing prices using both structured data and house images.
Dataset:
Housing Sales Dataset + Custom Image Dataset (your own or any public source)
Instructions:
● Use CNNs to extract features from images
● Combine extracted image features with tabular data
● Train a model using both modalities
● Evaluate performance using MAE and RMSE

Skills Gained:
● Multimodal machine learning
● Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
● Feature fusion (image + tabular)
● Regression modeling and evaluation
